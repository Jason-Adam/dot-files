# Dot Files  
Repository for setting up my development enviornment on a new Mac.  

## Install  
You can install everything at once by running the following command:  

```bash  
mkdir -p ~/code \
    && git clone https://github.com/Jason-Adam/dotfiles.git \
    && . ~/code/dotfiles/_install.sh
```  

Alternatively, you can navigate into the folder and run:  

```bash  
make all
```  

All of the individual install scripts can be run separately from the `make` commands or invoking the shell script directly.  

## Future  
Make Linux compatible
